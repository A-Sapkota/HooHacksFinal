Quantum Diagnosis
A hybrid diagnostic tool combining classical machine learning and quantum computing to aid in early disease detection.

Project Overview
Trained a sensor-based neural network to detect hand tremors and jerks—common symptoms in various neurological conditions.

Integrated the sensor’s output with additional symptom data to form a multi-dimensional input set.

Applied Grover’s Search Algorithm using IBM’s Qiskit framework to efficiently search for likely disease matches from a defined dataset.

Technologies Used
Python, TensorFlow/Keras (for the neural network)

Qiskit (for quantum simulation and Grover’s algorithm)

NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data preprocessing and visualization

Outcome
Demonstrated how quantum algorithms like Grover’s can be used in medical diagnostics to narrow down diseases faster than classical search approaches alone.

Explored the potential of quantum-enhanced healthcare, combining real-time biometric inputs with probabilistic quantum outputs.
